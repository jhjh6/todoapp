## My First React Todo App
This is my first app built with React. Initially, I planned to implement an account system with authentication for the Todo app, but I encountered some challenges. Instead, I decided to simplify the project and created a basic Todo app.

## Features
Add, edit, and delete tasks
Simple, user-friendly interface

## What I learned
Basic React concepts like state and props
How to manage user interactions with forms
Handling task data (adding, editing, deleting)
